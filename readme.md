# SCVITool
SCVI Tool is a very simple tool for backing up and restoring Soulcalibur VI save data.<br>
I made SCVITool for myself to backup my save data as Soulcalibur VI can corrupt saves seemingly randomly.<br>
You are free to use this software as you wish, but I do not take any responsibility for lost data, corrupt files or any
form of damage that may occur.

## Usage
Clicking the "Backup" button will create a copy of the "Saved" folder called "Saved_Backup" in the same folder.<br>
Clicking the "Restore" button will check if a backup exists and if so, it will delete the "Saved" folder, create a copy
of the "Saved_Backup" folder called "Saved" in the same folder.
